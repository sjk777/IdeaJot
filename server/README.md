Backend Proposal

# Backend Development:

## Set Up Your Java Backend:

- set up dependencies needed for backend(~10min)
- setup db for user and note(~30 min(?))


### User Authentication:
- implement Oauth2 based user authentication.
- will be using Github and Google(tutorial uses Github want to implement Google)


### API Endpoints:
-RESTful API endpots
- need to make it so only the user can access their notes(authorization integration)

### User Management:
- need to tie in user registration and note association with user accounts
- some sort of profile management system for the user

### Note Management:

Develop endpoints and logic for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving notes.


### Testing:

Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability of your backend API.
 - will use mockito

# Front End Development:

### React
 
    - have a functioning login component
    - need navbar functioning
    - need to make sure user can only access notes once authorized
    - some kind of editing toolbar api(need to still resarch)
    - look into bootstrap rows and column
    - need to see variations of organizing components
    - notion clone tutorials(?)
    - will use tailwind css and bootstrap

### (icebox) Next.js
    - want to try next.js for front end if time allows
    - want to try shadcdn(?) need to look into
